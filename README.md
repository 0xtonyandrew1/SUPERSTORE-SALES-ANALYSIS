## DATA PREPARATION:

### CLEANING:

The cleaning process was done in power query in which we checked for blanks, duplicate, spellings and inconsistencies. The data returned no blanks, duplicates, wrong spellings or Inconsistencies, each column were checked for right data type. It proves data quality and integrity.

### Transformation: 

The Data was seperated into four different queries and the columns were re-ordered into the right format.

### MODELING

I created a relationship in Excel to connect all four queries to the fact table (ORDERS QUERIE) into order to carry out a PIVOT TABLE ANALYSIS.
